# Time Complexity : O(n)(first while loop)+O(n)(second while loop) = O(n)

# Why It‚Äôs Not ùëÇ(ùëõ2):
# Key Point: These loops are sequential, not nested. The second while loop runs after the first loop has finished.
# Since they run one after the other, their time complexities are added rather than multiplied.


# Space Complexity: O(1) ‚Äî The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space
